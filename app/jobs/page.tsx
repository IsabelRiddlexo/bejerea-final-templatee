          Ever since I was six, my parents have trusted me to watch over my
          little sister and brother. Whether it is a trip to the dentist or an
          emergency stafff meeting, I have been there to make sure my siblings
          are fed and happy. I have been at this for almost 8 years, with no
          accidents or injuries happening under my watch. I have gotten great
          reviews and been paid pretty well for my work.

          I used to struggle with writing when I was young, but after taking
          courses, I have improved greatly. My teachers praise my essays and
          love my arguements. Whenever I am asssigned to write for school,
          whether it be creative or an essay, I make sure to put my all into it.
          My creative writing has been very successful online, with one book
          getting over 93 thousand reads.

          Another job I excel at is cleaning houses. I have had experience since
          I was seven, always made sure to organize my room and wash my plate
          after eating meals. When I became a teen, my parents started to pay me
          to take care of the house, which I still continue to do. They are very
          satisfied with my work, and they make sure I know it. Every day, I
          start the day off cooking, and end it cleaning my mess up.

          The most recent job, however, that I have experience with is designing
          clothing. In the first semester of my 9th year, I took a fashion
          course. Ever since then, I have been exploring designing and sewing. I
          have planned out and sewn pajama pants, pillows, and small scale
          stuffed animals. My friends all love my designs, and my mother, who is
          a great seamstress, admires my work.
